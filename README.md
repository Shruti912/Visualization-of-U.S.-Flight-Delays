# Visualization-of-U.S.-Flight-Delays

## Abstract
The aviation industry faces considerable operational and financial difficulties due to flight delays and cancellations, affecting airlines, airports, and passengers. This project introduces an interactive data visualization framework designed for the analysis of U.S. flight delay data, considering various factors such as airlines, airports, causes of delays, timeframes, and geographical areas.
The project utilizes Python tools, including Pandas, Panel, HoloViews, hvPlot, and GeoViews, to facilitate exploratory analysis via interactive dashboards and visualizations. The project's main elements are: (1) summary statistics regarding flight cancellations and diversions, categorized by airport, month, and year; (2) combined charts that compare total delay times with factors such as weather, carrier, or air traffic; and (3) geospatial heatmaps that display the spatial distribution of average delays across airports.This project demonstrates how interactive visual analytics can support data-driven decision-making for airlines, airport authorities, and policymakers aiming  to improve flight reliability and operational efficiency.
